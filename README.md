# Mastermind
Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players.

The game is played using:
- a decoding board, with a shield at one end covering a row of four large holes, and twelve (or ten, or eight, or six) additional rows containing four large holes next to a set of four small holes;
- code pegs of six different colors (or more; see Variations below), with round heads, which will be placed in the large holes on the board; and
- key pegs, some black and some gold, which are flat-headed and smaller than the code pegs; they will be placed in the small holes on the board.

One player becomes the codemaker, the other the codebreaker. The codemaker chooses a pattern of five code pegs. The codemaker places the chosen pattern in the five holes covered by the shield, visible to the codemaker but not to the codebreaker.

The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within twelve turns. Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board. Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing from zero to five key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess. A black key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position. A gold key peg indicates the existence of a correct color code peg placed in the wrong position.

Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or all rows on the decoding board are full.
